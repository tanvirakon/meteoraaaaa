2. how did i achieve pagination(show more button)?  
   Setup Initial State:
   In the onCreated lifecycle hook of the mainbody template, you defined a reactive variable limit to hold the number of posts to fetch initially. This reactive variable makes the number of posts loaded dynamic.
   Subscribe to Data:
   Inside the autorun block, you set up a subscription to the tasks publication, passing the current value of the limit reactive variable. This ensures that whenever limit changes, the subscription re-runs, fetching the latest set of posts.
   Retrieve Posts:
   In the helper function posts, you used the find method on the TasksCollection, specifying a limit based on the reactive variable. This retrieves the current set of posts to be displayed, ordered by their creation date.
   Handle "Load More" Events:
   In the events block, you defined a click event for a "load more" button. This event handler increases the limit reactive variable by a fixed number (e.g., 2). Increasing the limit triggers the autorun to re-subscribe and fetch more posts.
   Reactivity in Action:
   Because of the reactive nature of the limit variable, when it changes, the autorun re-executes, causing the publication to fetch more posts, and the helper to re-evaluate, thus displaying additional posts in the UI.
3. page pagination(1,2,3,..) whaat happerns cliking any a tag there?  
   Event Listener Setup:
   The code listens for a click event on elements with the class .page-link. This class is typically applied to the pagination links (e.g., links for pages 1, 2, 3, ...).
   Event Handler Function:
   When a .page-link element is clicked, the corresponding event handler function is triggered. This function takes two arguments:
   event: This object contains information about the event that was triggered, such as the target element (the link that was clicked).
   instance: This refers to the current template instance. It allows access to reactive variables and other instance-specific data.
   Extracting the Page Number:
   event.target: Refers to the clicked DOM element (the specific pagination link).
   event.target.dataset.page: Accesses the data-page attribute of the clicked link. This attribute holds the page number that the link represents.
   parseInt(..., 10): Converts the data-page value from a string to an integer. The 10 specifies that the string should be parsed as a decimal number. This step is crucial because data-\* attributes are always strings, and we need a number for setting the current page.
   Updating the Current Page Reactive Variable:
   instance.currentPage.set(page): Updates the reactive variable currentPage in the template instance to the clicked page number.
   This update triggers reactivity, causing any computations or helpers that depend on currentPage to re-run and update the displayed content accordingly.
   What Happens After Clicking a Pagination Link?
   Updating Data Subscription:
   By updating currentPage, the code triggers the reactive computation set up in the template's onCreated function (or elsewhere) to update the subscription.
   The subscription fetches the data for the newly selected page, based on the new value of currentPage.
   Re-rendering the Template:
   The helpers that use currentPage to determine which items to display will re-run. This results in updating the displayed list of items (e.g., showing a new set of posts or todos).
   The page content changes to reflect the data for the selected page.
   User Experience:
   The user sees the content for the page number they clicked on. For example, if they click on 2, they see items corresponding to the second set (e.g., items 11-20 if showing 10 items per page).
